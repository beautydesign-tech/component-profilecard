# Profile card component

## a project by Frontend Mentor

**With this challenge, I am working on building a library of basic components from design mockups with HTML and CSS - and practice writing markup**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a profile card component and get it looking as close to the design that was provided.

## My Tools

- VSCode
- Slack community | Frontend Mentor's [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) **#help** channel
- YouTube Tutorials

## My Workflow

1. Creating a repository.
   If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configured repository to publish your code to a URL. This will be useful to share work when receiving help from the community using the repo URL. Recommended: Use [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel).
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. Determining CSS classes for reusable styles and id's for single elements.
4. Next, structure the content with HTML.
5. Create the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Beautify! Add styles by area, top down.

## Deployment
